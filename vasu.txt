Coming to my strengths I can similarly accept both failure and success. I would like to face challenges that I cannot do, aside from the fact that my mom encourages in every situation that is one of the greatest strengths. We are three members of our family.  My mother is a teacher. I have a sibling who is studying the tenth standard. My hobbies include playing cricket, cycling, and surfing the Internet to learn new technologies. My short-term goal is to obtain employment in a reputable company where I can improve my skills and acquire knowledge.My long-term objective is to look at what I have achieved during the initial period, and I look forward to seeing what remains to be done.
